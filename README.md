# AIOS (AI Operating System) Project

AIOS is an experimental project that aims to bridge Assembly language with high-level operations using AI models for translation and execution. The system provides real-time visualization and interaction with assembly code execution through QEMU.

## Implemented Features

### Boot Loader (boot.asm)
- Memory Management Operations
  - âœ… Memory allocation (`alloc`)
  - âœ… Memory deallocation (`dealloc`)
  - âœ… Memory information retrieval (`meminfo`)
  - âœ… Memory copying (`memcopy`)
- System Integration
  - âœ… QEMU execution support
  - âœ… Enhanced command processing

### AI Model (ai_model.py)
- Core Functionality
  - âœ… Assembly to binary/hex translation
  - âœ… Enhanced command processing
  - âœ… Training LLM integration
  - âœ… Environment LLM integration
- Learning System
  - âœ… Reinforcement learning rewards
  - âœ… Feedback loop implementation
  - âœ… Model state tracking

### GUI Components
- Model State View (model_state_view.py)
  - âœ… Real-time operation monitoring
  - âœ… Color-coded response display
  - âœ… Command execution history
  - âœ… State information panel
  - âœ… Export functionality
- Main Interface (aios_gui.py)
  - âœ… Code editor integration
  - âœ… QEMU panel
  - âœ… Training panel
  - âœ… Chat interface
  - âœ… Session management

### Testing
- âœ… Memory operations test suite (test_aios_memory.py)
- âœ… Basic command execution tests
- âœ… State tracking validation
